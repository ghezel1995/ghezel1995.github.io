    description:
      'Front-end and back-end are two important terms used in web development. Front-end refers to the part of a website or web application that the user interacts with, while back-end refers to the part of the website or application that the user does not see and includes the server, application, and database that power the website. Front-end development involves creating the user interface and experience that the user sees and interacts with on a website or  application. This includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming  languages, as well as various front-end frameworks and libraries  like React, Angular, and Vue. Back-end development, on the other  hand, involves creating the server-side of a website or application.  This includes creating the database, server, and application logic that runs in the background to power the website or application.  Back-end developers typically use programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, or Java, as well as various frameworks like Django,  Flask, Ruby on Rails, and Spring. In summary, front-end developers  focus on the user interface and experience, while back-end  developers focus on the server-side and logic that powers the  website or application. Both are important and necessary for creating a fully functional and effective website or application.',

    description:
      'Back-end developers are responsible for the server-side development of web applications. They work on the underlying logic, database interactions, and server configuration that power the front-end of a website or web application. Back-end developers typically use server-side programming languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, or Node.js, and frameworks such as Django, Ruby on Rails, Spring, Laravel, or Express.js to build the server-side of a web application.',
    qouteTitle: 'Back-end developer vs. back-end engineer',
    qoute:
      'Back-end developers and engineers have similar technical skills, but different responsibilities. A back-end developer is like a teacher, whereas a back-end engineer is like a school principal who creates the big-picture strategy. Back-end developers tend to focus on smaller parts of the whole, such as applications and programs, working with teams to prove their design methods are viable.',

They use their  skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other programming languages to build and design the front end of websites or applications that users interact with directly..',
    qouteTitle:
      'In addition to their technical skills, front-end developers need to have a good eye for design and user experience. They need to understand the principles of good design and be able to apply them to their work.',
    qoute:
      'Front-end developers often work closely with back-end developers to ensure that the front-end of a website or application works  seamlessly with the back-end. They also need to be familiar with version control tools such as Git and be able to work  collaboratively with other developers on a team.',
